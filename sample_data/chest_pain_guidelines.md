# Medical Diagnosis Guidelines

## Chest Pain Evaluation

### Overview
Chest pain is one of the most common presenting complaints in emergency medicine and primary care. Proper evaluation is crucial to identify life-threatening conditions.

### Initial Assessment
1. **Vital Signs**: Blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation
2. **Pain Characteristics**: Location, quality, radiation, duration, triggers
3. **Associated Symptoms**: Shortness of breath, nausea, diaphoresis, dizziness

### Differential Diagnosis

#### Life-Threatening Causes
- **Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)**
  - Symptoms: Crushing chest pain, left arm radiation, diaphoresis
  - Tests: ECG, cardiac enzymes (troponin), chest X-ray
  - Treatment: Aspirin, nitroglycerin, urgent cardiology consultation

- **Pulmonary Embolism**
  - Symptoms: Sudden onset chest pain, shortness of breath, hemoptysis
  - Tests: D-dimer, CT pulmonary angiogram, arterial blood gas
  - Treatment: Anticoagulation, thrombolysis in severe cases

- **Aortic Dissection**
  - Symptoms: Tearing chest pain radiating to back
  - Tests: CT angiography, transesophageal echocardiogram
  - Treatment: Blood pressure control, surgical consultation

#### Common Non-Cardiac Causes
- **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)**
- **Musculoskeletal pain**
- **Anxiety/Panic attacks**
- **Pneumonia**
- **Pleuritis**

### Management Protocol
1. Stabilize patient if unstable
2. Obtain immediate ECG
3. IV access and cardiac monitoring
4. Pain relief as appropriate
5. Diagnostic workup based on clinical suspicion
6. Consultation with specialists as needed

### Red Flags
- Hemodynamic instability
- Severe or worsening pain
- Abnormal ECG findings
- Elevated cardiac biomarkers
- Signs of heart failure

Early recognition and appropriate management of chest pain can be life-saving. Always consider the worst-case scenario first and work to rule out life-threatening causes.
